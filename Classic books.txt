Yes, the ghosts are fascinating; but what’s really admirable here is James’ signature subtlety of style.",

{"name": "Rosemary's Baby",
"description": "If, for some reason, you’re doubting whether Rosemary’s Baby is one of the best horror books of all time, let us remind that it was the bestselling horror novel of the 1960s, launching a boom in the commercial success of horror fiction in general. As with many stories in the genre, Rosemary’s Baby starts out pretty innocently, and then things take a turn for the worst: Rosemary and Guy have just moved into a beautiful Manhattan apartment, and life is good. That is, until their dream home starts to turn into a living nightmare, and they begin to feel that the devil lives only a few doors down.",

Part family drama and all horror, it delivers on all fronts.",
